Batteries can get hot, and their performance can suffer, when high-powered electric motors, plus heavy-footed drivers, try to draw too much power from them too quickly.

Today, supercapacitors are usually used in roles that involve quick, short bursts of energy such as to quickly restart a gasoline engine.

"", "" Each of the car's four wheels would be independently powered by an electric motor.

', "" Unlocking the device with Face ID is the most hyped new feature on the iPhone X. However, it's not a terribly compelling reason to buy the device. "", "" The collection of cameras and sensors takes a 3D scan of your face to make sure you're who you say you are. It then unlocks the phone. "", ' It also replaces the fingerprint sensor to make room for the screen. You can also enter a passcode or turn off the security features altogether. ', "" In my tests, Face ID was impressive but not perfect. My phone unlocked in a variety of lighting situations, but there were a multiple times when it just wouldn't read my face. "", "" It feels slower than using a fingerprint. After it confirms your face, you're stuck staring at the lock screen until you swipe up to get into the device. A setting on other iPhones lets you go directly to your home screen when it's unlocked with a finger. That's not an option for your face. "", "" Perhaps I'm lazy, but I don't want to lift up the device every time I use it. It will also make checking Instagram during meetings harder, too. On an iPhone 8 and earlier models, a finger scan made unlocking easy. "", "" The iPhone X is not the first smartphone to add face detection. Samsung's Galaxy S8 has a similar but less secure feature.

The corners of the screen are rounded, which crops parts of any movie or photo you're viewing. "", ' The Face ID cameras and sensors are also in a small black rectangle on the front of the device, which cuts into the top of the screen. There is a tiny bit of usable display left on each side of this notch where you can see the time or how much battery you have left. But if you watch a movie full screen, the notch creates a distracting dead space. I opted to make videos smaller rather than look at it.

The colors pop and images are sharp, but if you glance at it from an angle, it displays a blue-ish hue. This is a known issue with OLED screens, but it's surprising that Apple didn't think it was a deal breaker. "", "" A learning curve that isn't very Apple "", ' To fill the void left by the Home button, the iPhone X has added new gestures (the different swipes you make with a finger). The process of learning them is a pain, and some of the new options are more work than before.

Another example: To bring up the Control Center, you swipe down from the top-right corner of the device, which is out of the way for most thumbs. ', "" I don't doubt anyone's ability to master a few new finger movements. But these changes feel like a move away from the dead-simple interface that's made the iPhone the easiest smartphone to use. "", ' OK, but should I buy it? ', "" If you want the best smartphone camera but find the iPhone 8 Plus size to be too bulky, the iPhone X is a solid choice. Early adopters and and selfie fans will likely find joy in the front-facing camera's features and integration with apps in the future. "", ' Overall, you must be comfortable re-learning some navigation basics and have no qualms about dropping a few hundred dollars extra on it too.
